The Valorant quiz utilizes a dictionary of 11 questions requiring user input and is based on my own valorant preferences. This was intended to test my friends how well they know me. At the end you get a letter grade and percentage correct.

The Apex weapon quiz has 11 multiple choice questions in which each question is its own object with a designated answer attribute. The questions are based on season 10. At the end of the quiz your score is represented as a percentage and the questions you missed are displayed.
